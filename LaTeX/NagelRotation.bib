abstract = {In many regions of the visual system, the activity of a neuron is normalized by the activity of other neurons in the same region. Here we show that a similar normalization occurs during olfactory processing in the Drosophila antennal lobe. We exploit the orderly anatomy of this circuit to independently manipulate feedforward and lateral input to second-order projection neurons (PNs). Lateral inhibition increases the level of feedforward input needed to drive PNs to saturation, and this normalization scales with the total activity of the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) population. Increasing total ORN activity also makes PN responses more transient. Strikingly, a model with just two variables (feedforward and total ORN activity) accurately predicts PN odor responses. Finally, we show that discrimination by a linear decoder is facilitated by two complementary transformations: the saturating transformation intrinsic to each processing channel boosts weak signals, while normalization helps equalize responses to different stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Synaptic plasticity occurs in several regions of the vertebrate brain and is believed to mediate the storage of behaviorally significant information during learning. Synaptic plasticity is well demonstrated in most cases, but the behavioral meaning of the relevant neural signals and the behavioral role of the plasticity are uncertain. In this paper we describe a case of synaptic plasticity which involves identifiable sensory and motor signals and which appears to mediate the storage of an image of past sensory input. Corollary discharge signals associated with the motor command that drives the electric organ are prominent in the electrosensory lobe of mormyrid electric fish. Some of these corollary discharge signals elicit a negative image or representation of the electrosensory input pattern that has followed recent motor commands. When the temporal and spatial pattern of sensory input changes, the corollary discharge effect also changes in a corresponding manner. The cellular mechanisms by which the corollary discharge-evoked representation is stored were investigated by intracellular recording from cells of the electrosensory lobe and pairing intracellular current pulses with the corollary discharge signal. The results indicate that the representation of recent sensory input is stored by means of anti-Hebbian plasticity at the synapses between corollary discharge-conveying fibers and cells of the electrosensory lobe. The results also suggest that dendritic spikes and plasticity at inhibitory synapses are involved in the phenomenon.},

abstract = {In the olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster, it is relatively straightforward to target in vivo measurements of neural activity to specific processing channels. This, together with the numerical simplicity of the Drosophila olfactory system, has produced rapid gains in our understanding of Drosophila olfaction. This review summarizes the neurophysiology of the first two layers of this system: the peripheral olfactory receptor neurons and their postsynaptic targets in the antennal lobe. We now understand in some detail the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that shape odor representations in these neurons. Together, these mechanisms imply that interesting neural adaptations to environmental statistics have occurred. These mechanisms also place some fundamental constraints on early sensory processing that pose challenges for higher brain regions. These findings suggest some general principles with broad relevance to early sensory processing in other modalities.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Local inhibitory neurons control the timing of neural activity in many circuits. To understand how inhibition controls timing, it is important to understand the dynamics of activity in populations of local inhibitory interneurons, as well as the mechanisms that underlie these dynamics. Here we describe thein vivoresponse dynamics of a large population of inhibitory local neurons (LNs) in theDrosophila melanogasterantennal lobe, the analog of the vertebrate olfactory bulb, and we dissect the network and intrinsic mechanisms that give rise to these dynamics. Some LNs respond to odor onsets ("ON" cells) and others to offsets ("OFF" cells), whereas still others respond at both times. Moreover, different LNs signal odor concentration fluctuations on different timescales. Some respond rapidly, and can track rapid concentration fluctuations. Others respond slowly, and are best at tracking slow fluctuations. We found a continuous spectrum of preferred stimulation timescales among LNs, as well as a continuum of ON-OFF behavior. Usingin vivowhole-cell recordings, we show that the timing of an LN's response (ON vs OFF) can be predicted from the interplay of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents that it receives. Meanwhile, the preferred timescale of an LN is related to its intrinsic properties. These results illustrate how a population of inhibitory interneurons can collectively encode bidirectional changes in stimulus intensity on multiple timescales, and how this can arise via an interaction between synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Most neural circuits contain diverse populations of inhibitory interneurons. The way inhibition shapes network activity will depend on the spiking dynamics of the interneuron population. Here we describe the dynamics of activity in a large population of inhibitory interneurons in the first brain relay of the fruit fly olfactory system. Because odor plumes fluctuate on multiple timescales, the drive to this circuit can vary over a range of frequencies. We show how synaptic and cellular mechanisms interact to recruit different interneurons at different times, and in response to different temporal features of odor stimuli. As a result, inhibition is recruited over a range of conditions, and there is the potential to tune the timing of inhibition as the environment changes.},

@article{Nagel2011,
abstract = {The responses of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to odors have complex dynamics. Using genetics and pharmacology, we found that these dynamics in Drosophila ORNs could be separated into sequential steps, corresponding to transduction and spike generation. Each of these steps contributed distinct dynamics. Transduction dynamics could be largely explained by a simple kinetic model of ligand-receptor interactions, together with an adaptive feedback mechanism that slows transduction onset. Spiking dynamics were well described by a differentiating linear filter that was stereotyped across odors and cells. Genetic knock-down of sodium channels reshaped this filter, implying that it arises from the regulated balance of intrinsic conductances in ORNs. Complex responses can be understood as a consequence of how the stereotyped spike filter interacts with odor- and receptor-specific transduction dynamics. However, in the presence of rapidly fluctuating natural stimuli, spiking simply increases the speed and sensitivity of encoding.},

abstract = {Mormyrid electric fish are a model system for understanding how neural circuits predict the sensory consequences of motor acts. Medium ganglion cells in the electrosensory lobe create negative images that predict sensory input resulting from the fish's electric organ discharge (EOD). Previous studies have shown that negative images can be created through plasticity at granule cell-medium ganglion cell synapses, provided that granule cell responses to the brief EOD command are sufficiently varied and prolonged. Here we show that granule cells indeed provide such a temporal basis and that it is well-matched to the temporal structure of self-generated sensory inputs, allowing rapid and accurate sensory cancellation and explaining paradoxical features of negative images. We also demonstrate an unexpected and critical role of unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in generating the required delayed responses. These results provide a mechanistic account of how copies of motor commands are transformed into sensory predictions.},
